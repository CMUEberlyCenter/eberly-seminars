        Dear <%= @participant.name %>,
    </p>

    <p>
        We have confirmed your space in the following sessions:<br/><br/>

        <%= render :partial => "registration_details", :object => @registration %>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are still interested in attending this session, you do
        not need to take further action. If you need accommodations,
        please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:eberly-ctr@andrew.cmu.edu">eberly-ctr@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are no longer interested in or able to attend this
        session, please log in to cancel your space as soon as possible
        so we can accommodate other interested graduate students. If you
        are a no-show for a session (i.e., are confirmed but don’t
        cancel in advance or attend) more than once, you will be moved
        to the waitlist for the semester’s remaining seminars and workshops.
    </p>

        you!
