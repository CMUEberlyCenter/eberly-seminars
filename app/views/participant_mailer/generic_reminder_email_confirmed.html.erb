      Dear <%= @registration.participant.name %>,
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As a reminder, you have been confirmed to attend the following
      session:<br/><br/>
      
      <%= render :partial => "registration_details", :object => @registration %>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you are still interested in attending this session, you do
      not need to take any further action.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are no longer interested in or able to attend this
      session, please log in to cancel your space as soon as possible
      so we can accommodate other interested graduate students. If you
      are a no-show for a session (i.e., are confirmed but don’t cancel
      in advance or attend) more than once, you will be moved to the
      waitlist for the semester’s remaining seminars and workshops.
    </p>

      Thank you again for your interest, and we look forward to
      working with you!
